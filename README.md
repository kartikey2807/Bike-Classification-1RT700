# Bike Classification
* Given weather parameters like temperature, wind speed, dew, etc.
* Plot trends and predict *demand in bike*
* Use logistic regression
* Add SMOTE and **polynomial** Feature Expansion
* This can better fit training data and reduce bias
* Metrics to report: F1-score

**Results**
| Model | F1-score on validation set |
| :- | :- |
| Regression with feature expansion | 0.86 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.85 |
| Regression with SMOTE | 0.82 |
